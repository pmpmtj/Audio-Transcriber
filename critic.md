Pedro—nice, tight scope. I read through what you attached and here’s a straight-shooting review of the project as it stands.

# Conformist (what’s solid and coherent)

* **Single job, done cleanly.** The CLI wraps a single operation (transcribe one audio file → JSON) with sensible flags: `--language`, `--language-routing`, `--probe-seconds`, `--no-probe`, `--out`, `--temperature`, debugging and logging controls. Defaults are pulled from a central config, not duplicated in code. 
* **Centralized config.** `TranscriptionConfig` holds models, allowed extensions, defaults, ffmpeg settings, language keyword lists, logging settings, and standardized exit codes—this makes behavior predictable and easy to tweak. 
* **Input hygiene.** You validate file existence and extension; unsupported types and missing files raise clear errors. 
* **Language routing that stays optional.** By default you let Whisper auto-detect. If enabled, you do a fast probe (ffmpeg slice → cheap model → keyword scan) and then run the full pass—nice balance between speed and cost. 
* **Logging done right.** Dedicated logger factory, console/file handlers, per-module configs, ability to disable file logging via CLI. 
* **Testing culture is strong.** You’ve broken out tests by layers (config/core/cli/logging), use fixtures, cover happy paths + edge cases, and target ≥80% coverage. CLI helpers are split so each can be unit-tested (e.g., `setup_logging_from_args`, `perform_transcription`, `output_transcription_result`).   

# Critic (what’s brittle or inconsistent)

* **A few test import paths look wrong.** In some patches you reference `transcribe_audio.src.core.language_detection` (note the extra `src`) while elsewhere the real package path is `transcribe_audio.core.language_detection`. That will create ghost mocks or test flakiness. Fix all to the actual import path. 
* **Keyword-based language detection is crude.** The routing logic relies on static keyword lists matched on a short probe. Mixed speech, code-switching, or domain vocabularies will slip through. It’s fine as a heuristic, but don’t over-trust it; you already fall back to Whisper auto-detect, which is good. 
* **OpenAI SDK handling is split.** Some places create a client at the top level; `detect_language_with_probe` re-imports SDK and can create its own client if `client` is None. Those multiple code paths make error handling and configuration (timeouts, retries, headers) harder to reason about and test. 
* **Dependency looseness.** `openai>=1.40` is broad. For a CLI intended to “just work,” a tighter pin or at least a tested upper bound would reduce surprises from API changes. Your tests help, but they mock quite a lot, which can mask real-API drift. 
* **ffmpeg assumptions.** You treat ffmpeg absence/failure as non-fatal (good), but users won’t know they lost the “probe” benefit unless they read logs carefully. Consider surfacing a one-line CLI info on first fallback. Current stderr warning exists in helper, but a user-visible notice in CLI would be clearer. 
* **API key UX.** You hard-fail if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing (good), but there’s no support for `.env`/config file detection—which many users expect by default. 

# Advisor (targeted, low-bloat upgrades that keep the scope small)

1. **Unify client creation & timeouts.**
   Add a tiny `get_client()` in one place, with optional env-driven timeouts/retries; pass the same client through all paths (routing + full transcription). That kills duplication and makes behavior predictable. 
2. **Straighten imports in tests.**
   Replace every `transcribe_audio.src.core...` with `transcribe_audio.core...`. Also standardize all `mocker.patch()` targets to the import path actually used by the code under test. This alone will prevent “mock didn’t apply” head-scratchers. 
3. **Tighten model/config surface—but keep defaults.**
   Your defaults already live in `TranscriptionConfig`. Add tiny helpers you test explicitly: `get_probe_model()`, `get_main_model()`, `get_log_dir()`. It clarifies intent and reduces accidental key typos in code and tests. 
4. **Make routing telemetry explicit.**
   In CLI output (stdout JSON), you already enrich `_meta` with `language_routing_enabled`, `routed_language`, `probe_seconds`. Add `_meta.ffmpeg_used: true|false` so users understand when you really used a slice. 
5. **Surface a gentle ffmpeg hint.**
   On first run where routing is enabled but ffmpeg is missing/fails, log one INFO line: “ffmpeg not found; probing skipped; falling back to full-file detection.” Keep it single-line to avoid noise. You already print a WARNING in the helper—bubble a clean INFO up in CLI too. 
6. **.env convenience (optional).**
   Without growing scope: if a `.env` exists in CWD, auto-load it (only keys you already use). If not present, do nothing. This preserves simplicity while matching developer expectations. The rest of the tool remains stateless. (Related to your current API-key check.) 
7. **Lock the dependency minimally.**
   Move to `openai>=1.40,<2.0` (or whatever you actually verified against) and document it in README/tests to avoid surprise breaking changes. Pyproject currently leaves the upper bound open. 
8. **Tiny UX polish: `--stdin` for file list (future-proof).**
   Still within “simple transcriber”: accept multiple paths via stdin (one per line) to batch in shells, but process strictly one-by-one and emit one JSON doc per line. Keep the single-file path as the default positional arg to avoid scope creep.

## **kept surgical so we don’t “expand just because.”**
